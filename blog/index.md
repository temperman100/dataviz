　First I thought I would ask gpt to give me the code for the website.But the first way I asked him was to explain about the code, not to give the code.

　Next I told gpt to specify html and css as the code to be used.

I copied and pasted the code that came out at this time and it looked like this. I had never built a website before, so I didn't fully understand how great it was, so I showed it to Dr. yoh and he said it was amazing.

GPT, you're awesome!

　Also, this code was written in two places together, so we decided to have it separated by html and css.
　This whole process only took about two minutes.

GPT gave me the code for each and I decided to separate them.
